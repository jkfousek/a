# Why Are Files Getting Created Outside of My Folders?

There are several reasons why files might be getting created outside of your intended folders:

## 1. Incorrect Paths in Configuration
Ensure that the paths specified in your configuration files (e.g., `settings.json`, `keybindings.json`) are correct and point to the desired directories.

## 2. Default Save Locations
Some applications have default save locations that might not align with your project structure. Check the settings of the application you are using to ensure it saves files in the correct location.

## 3. Relative vs. Absolute Paths
Using relative paths instead of absolute paths can sometimes lead to files being saved in unintended locations. Verify that you are using the correct path type for your needs.

## 4. Misconfigured Extensions or Plugins
Extensions or plugins in your development environment might be misconfigured, causing files to be saved in the wrong place. Review the settings and documentation for any extensions or plugins you are using.

## 5. User Error
Double-check that you are saving files in the correct location. It's easy to accidentally save a file in the wrong directory, especially if you are working quickly.

## 6. Version Control System
If you are using a version control system like Git, ensure that your `.gitignore` file is correctly configured to include or exclude the appropriate files and directories.

## 7. Environment Variables
Environment variables can affect where files are saved. Make sure that any relevant environment variables are set correctly.

## 8. Application Bugs
Occasionally, bugs in the application you are using can cause files to be saved in the wrong location. Check for updates or patches that might address these issues.

By addressing these potential issues, you can ensure that files are created in the correct locations within your project structure.
